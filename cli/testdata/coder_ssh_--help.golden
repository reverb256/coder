[93mOPTIONS:[0m
  [94m-[0m[94mA[0m, [94m--[0m[94mforward-agent[0m bool, [94m$CODER_SSH_FORWARD_AGENT[0m
          Specifies whether to forward the SSH agent specified in
          $SSH_AUTH_SOCK.

  [94m-[0m[94mG[0m, [94m--[0m[94mforward-gpg[0m bool, [94m$CODER_SSH_FORWARD_GPG[0m
          Specifies whether to forward the GPG agent. Unsupported on Windows
          workspaces, but supports all clients. Requires gnupg (gpg, gpgconf) on
          both the client and workspace. The GPG agent must already be running
          locally and will not be started for you. If a GPG agent is already
          running in the workspace, it will be attempted to be killed.

      [94m--[0m[94midentity-agent[0m string, [94m$CODER_SSH_IDENTITY_AGENT[0m
          Specifies which identity agent to use (overrides $SSH_AUTH_SOCK),
          forward agent must also be enabled.

  [94m-[0m[94ml[0m, [94m--[0m[94mlog-dir[0m string, [94m$CODER_SSH_LOG_DIR[0m

          Enter workspace immediately after the agent has connected. This is the
          default if the template has configured the agent startup script
          behavior as non-blocking.
          DEPRECATED: Use --wait instead.

  [94m-[0m[94mR[0m, [94m--[0m[94mremote-forward[0m string, [94m$CODER_SSH_REMOTE_FORWARD[0m
          Enable remote port forwarding (remote_port:local_address:local_port).

          Specifies whether to emit SSH output over stdin/stdout.

      [94m--[0m[94mwait[0m yes|no|auto, [94m$CODER_SSH_WAIT[0m (default: auto)
          Specifies whether or not to wait for the startup script to finish
          executing. Auto means that the agent startup script behavior
          configured in the workspace template is used.

      [94m--[0m[94mworkspace-poll-interval[0m duration, [94m$CODER_WORKSPACE_POLL_INTERVAL[0m (default: 1m)
          Specifies how often to poll for workspace automated shutdown.
