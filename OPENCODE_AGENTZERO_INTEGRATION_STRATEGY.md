# OpenCode & Agent-Zero Integration Strategy for Coder

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive integration strategy for incorporating OpenCode (AI agent platform for IDEs) and Agent-Zero (agent orchestration framework) into Coder's existing agentic architecture. The strategy leverages Coder's modular design, agent registry, and task scheduling system to create a seamless integration that enhances developer productivity through AI-powered IDE features and sophisticated agent orchestration.

## 1. Integration Architecture

### Core Design Principles

- **Agent Interface Compliance**: Both OpenCode and Agent-Zero must implement Coder's `Agent` interface with `Name()`, `Supports()`, and `Execute()` methods
- **Registry Pattern**: Leverage the existing `Registry` for agent discovery and task routing
- **Task-Based Architecture**: All operations flow through the `Task` and `TaskResult` structures
- **Orchestrator Integration**: Agent-Zero extends the `Orchestrator` pattern for complex workflows

### Architecture Overview

```

### Component Responsibilities

- **OpenCode Agent**: Handles IDE integration, code generation, plugin management, and editor-specific AI tasks
- **Agent-Zero Agent**: Provides meta-orchestration, workflow composition, and cross-agent coordination
- **Coder Platform**: Manages authentication, authorization, task scheduling, and resource allocation

## 2. Deployment Models

### Deployment Options

| Model | Architecture | Use Case | Implementation |
|-------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **Workspace-Embedded** | OpenCode runs inside each workspace container | IDE/editor integration, user-specific configs | Deploy as sidecar container or process |
| **Platform-Service** | Agent-Zero runs as platform service | Cross-workspace orchestration, resource optimization | Deploy as Kubernetes deployment/service |
| **Hybrid-Optimized** | OpenCode per workspace, shared Agent-Zero pool | Balance isolation with resource efficiency | OpenCode in workspace, Agent-Zero in control plane |

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid-Optimized

The hybrid model provides the best balance of:
- **Isolation**: Each workspace gets its own OpenCode instance
- **Efficiency**: Shared Agent-Zero pool reduces resource overhead
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of IDE and orchestration components
- **Security**: Clear boundary between user and platform resources

## 3. API Integration Points

### New API Endpoints

#### OpenCode Endpoints
```
POST   /api/v2/agents/opencode/register
GET    /api/v2/agents/opencode/plugins
POST   /api/v2/agents/opencode/tasks
GET    /api/v2/agents/opencode/tasks/{taskID}
```

#### Agent-Zero Endpoints
```
POST   /api/v2/agents/agentzero/workflows
GET    /api/v2/agents/agentzero/workflows/{workflowID}
POST   /api/v2/agents/agentzero/compose

```

#### Shared Agent Endpoints
```
GET    /api/v2/agents/registry
POST   /api/v2/agents/execute
GET    /api/v2/agents/status/{agentName}
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **Authentication**: Use `apiKeyMiddleware` for all agent endpoints
- **Authorization**: Leverage `HTTPAuthorizer` with workspace/org scoping
- **Audit**: Integrate with `Auditor` for compliance tracking
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply `apiRateLimiter` to prevent abuse

### API Request/Response Examples

#### Execute OpenCode Task
```json
POST /api/v2/agents/opencode/tasks
{
  "type": "opencode",
  "payload": {
    "action": "generate_code",
    "language": "go",
    "prompt": "Create a REST API endpoint for user management",
    "context": {
      "workspace_id": "ws-123",
      "file_path": "api/users.go"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Create Agent-Zero Workflow
```json
POST /api/v2/agents/agentzero/workflows
{
  "name": "Full Stack Feature",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "backend",
      "agent": "opencode",
      "task": "generate_api"
    },
    {
      "id": "frontend",
      "agent": "opencode",
      "task": "generate_ui",
      "depends_on": ["backend"]
    },
    {
      "id": "deploy",
      "agent": "kubernetes",
      "task": "apply_manifest",
      "depends_on": ["backend", "frontend"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Workflow Orchestration

### Task Flow Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant CoderAPI
    participant Scheduler
    participant AgentZero
    participant OpenCode
    participant Infrastructure

    User->>CoderAPI: Submit complex task
    CoderAPI->>Scheduler: Schedule task
    Scheduler->>AgentZero: Route orchestration task

    AgentZero->>AgentZero: Analyze & decompose
    AgentZero->>OpenCode: Code generation subtask
    AgentZero->>Infrastructure: Resource provisioning

    OpenCode->>OpenCode: Execute IDE operations
    Infrastructure->>Infrastructure: Provision resources

    OpenCode-->>AgentZero: Code results
    Infrastructure-->>AgentZero: Resource handles

    AgentZero->>AgentZero: Compose results
    AgentZero-->>Scheduler: Workflow complete
    Scheduler-->>CoderAPI: Task result
    CoderAPI-->>User: Final output
```

### Orchestration Capabilities

1. **Task Decomposition**: Break complex requests into atomic operations
2. **Dependency Management**: Handle task dependencies and parallel execution
3. **State Management**: Maintain workflow state across agent invocations
4. **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic and fallback strategies
5. **Result Composition**: Aggregate outputs from multiple agents

### Integration Points

- **Task Types**: Register new task types for `opencode` and `agentzero` operations
- **Workflow Steps**: Extend `WorkflowStep` for agent-specific parameters
- **Result Aggregation**: Use `WorkflowResult` for complex outputs
- **Event Streaming**: WebSocket support for real-time progress updates

## 5. Security & Isolation

### Multi-Layer Security Model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Security Layers"
        Auth[Authentication<br/>OAuth/API Keys]
        Authz[Authorization<br/>RBAC/Workspace Scoping]
        Isolation[Isolation<br/>Container/Network]
        Secrets[Secrets<br/>Encrypted Storage]
        Audit[Audit<br/>Compliance Logging]
    end

    Auth --> Authz
    Authz --> Isolation
    Isolation --> Secrets
    Secrets --> Audit
```
