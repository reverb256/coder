# OpenCode & Agent-Zero Integration: Administrator Guide

## System Configuration & Management

- **Deployment:** Follow the [Deployment Guide](deployment.md) for initial setup.
- **Scaling:** Use Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or your preferred orchestrator to scale services.
- **Upgrades:** Pull latest code, rebuild, and restart services. Backup data before upgrading.

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Management:** Store API keys securely (environment variables, secrets manager).
- **Network Security:** Restrict access to API endpoints and agents using firewalls and VPNs.
- **Audit Logging:** Enable and monitor audit logs for all agent and workflow actions.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Assign least-privilege roles to users and admins.

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Metrics:** Integrate with Prometheus or similar tools for monitoring service health.
- **Logs:** Aggregate logs from backend, agents, and UI for diagnostics.
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for service failures, high latency, or security events.
- **Backups:** Regularly backup PostgreSQL database and configuration files.
- **Restore:** Test restore procedures periodically.

## Performance Tuning & Optimization

- **Resource Allocation:** Ensure sufficient CPU, memory, and storage for agents and backend.
- **Connection Pooling:** Tune database and API connection pools for expected load.
- **Caching:** Enable caching where supported to reduce API latency.
- **Template Optimization:** Minimize workspace template startup times.

## Advanced Configuration

- **Custom Templates:** Extend or modify workspace templates in [`examples/templates/opencode-agentzero/`](examples/templates/opencode-agentzero/).
- **Connector Settings:** Adjust timeouts, endpoints, and retry logic in connector configs.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automate deployment and testing using your CI/CD pipeline.
