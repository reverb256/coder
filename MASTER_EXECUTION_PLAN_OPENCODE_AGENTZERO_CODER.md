# Master Implementation Execution Plan: OpenCode & Agent-Zero Integration with Coder

## 1. Executive Summary

This master plan orchestrates the integration of OpenCode (AI agent platform) and Agent-Zero (orchestration framework) into Coder, leveraging modular agentic architecture to deliver advanced, secure, and scalable AI-powered IDE features. The plan aligns all workstreams—architecture, project management, QA/testing, and deployment—into a unified, actionable roadmap. Success is defined by seamless agent integration, robust orchestration, measurable productivity gains, and enterprise-grade security.

**Key Objectives:**
- Seamless integration of OpenCode and Agent-Zero with Coder’s agentic platform.
- Delivery of AI-powered IDE features and meta-orchestration.
- Secure, scalable, and auditable deployment.
- Measurable improvements in developer productivity and platform reliability.

**Success Criteria:**
- All integration phases completed on schedule.
- All agents pass validation and security gates.
- KPIs for performance, adoption, and reliability met or exceeded.
